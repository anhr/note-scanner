# Note Scanner
An app which can sight-read piano sheet music. Try it out at: http://k15z.github.io/note-scanner/

1. Divide a sheet of music up into lines
    - Just look for a lot of horizontal white space

2. Divide a line up into parts
    - Just look for some horizontal white space

3. Divide a part into measures
    - Just look for narrow vertical lines

4. Analyze each measure
    - treble/bass clef
    - time signatures
    - key signatures
    - notes/rests

5. Reassemble the music as a MusicXML file
